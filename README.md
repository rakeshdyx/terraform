# Terraform

## Basic of Terraform

**localplan dir**
- This is the beging of terraform.
- In `localfile.tf` file, I have taken example of `local` as provider and `file` as resource.
- Further, `pet` has taken as resource name.
- Under bracket, I have passed arguments.
- In case of different provider, there would be some mandatory and optional arguements. You may be use them based on your requirement.
- In my case I have used `filename` which is mandatory one, other is `content` which is optional.
